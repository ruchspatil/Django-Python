## Django Python - API Implementation:

This repository contains a set of REST APIs developed using Django for managing users, clients, and projects. The task involves building an API system where users can register, manage clients and their associated projects, and perform CRUD operations on these entities.

#### The goal is to design APIs for managing the following entities in the system:

1. User
2. Client
3. Project

### How to Run the Code:

#### Create a Superuser (to access the Django admin):

python manage.py createsuperuser

#### Run the Development Server:

python manage.py runserver
